# Language Detection using Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)

[Language Detection App](https://kashiekay-language-detection-rnn.streamlit.app/)

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on **detecting the language of input text** using a **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)**. The model is trained on a **Kaggle Language Detection Dataset** and deployed using an interactive **Streamlit** web application that allows users to input text and instantly receive the predicted language.

The objective of this project is to demonstrate how deep learning models can effectively understand and classify natural language sequences.


## 🧠 Project Structure

The project is divided into **three main components**:

### 1️⃣ Model Training

* Loading and preprocessing the Kaggle Language Detection dataset
* Text cleaning and tokenization
* Converting text into numerical sequences
* Building an RNN-based deep learning model
* Training and validating the model for multi-language classification

### 2️⃣ Model Prediction

* Using the trained RNN model to predict the **language of the input text**
* Supports prediction across multiple languages present in the dataset
* Outputs the most probable language label

### 3️⃣ Streamlit Deployment

* Interactive web application built using Streamlit
* Users can enter custom text in any supported language
* Displays the predicted language in real time
* Makes the model accessible to non-technical users
